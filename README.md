### What I learned

1. creating a react project with Vite

3. using styledComponents to scope css styling to components. Styled component with props and default props
4. using ReactRouter in my project
5. using nested Routes
6. Creating an AppLayout component and using the outlet component
7. using React Icons
8. using SuperBase for data management
9. React Query for API calls and CRUD functionality, duplication
10. Implemented pagination for data retrieved and displayed on the Bookings page. Then used prefetching to improve the user experience
11. using onBlur to update single values in a react form (i am not a fan. will need to work on it more)
12. create a reusable modal component and use the createPortal method to place the modal as a child of the body element instead of its regular dom tree positioning
13. used the cloneElement method to add the opens prop to the opened modal component allowing it to tell which modal window it should open
14. using the date-fns date utility library
15. using Toast(react-hot-toasts) library and react query for notifications and alerts
16. Filtering and sorting (both client-side with cabins and server-side with bookings)
17. custom spinner component for isLoading state
18. react-hook-form library for forms and validation to create and edit cabins
19. authorization, authorization, and protected routes component
20. lazy loading and using suspend api for routes
21. Adding a dark mode
22. Graphs and Charts using ReCharts library
23. handling react render errors with react-error-boundary

### Continued development

I want to continue to grow my knowledge of React and its many capabilities.
